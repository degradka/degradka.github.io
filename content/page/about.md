Hey there! I’m a high school student who loves making stuff — sometimes it even works! I’m all about diving into DIY projects, whether it’s 3D printing, programming, or inventing new useless gadgets. Sure, they don’t always make life easier (and sometimes they don’t work at all), but that’s part of the fun.

You know that feeling when you create something awesome in your head, but in reality, it’s more like a futuristic paperweight? Yeah, that’s my life. But I wouldn't have it any other way. I get a kick out of turning crazy ideas into real things, even if they end up as epic fails.

When I'm not busy accidentally making high-tech doorstops, you’ll find me coding up a sand simulation in Assembly or designing my next 3D print project. And occasionally, I dip my toes into game development — because why not add more chaos to the mix?

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I share my latest creations, mishaps, and everything in between. Stick around if you’re into DIY adventures, tech tinkering, and laughing at the occasional epic fail.
