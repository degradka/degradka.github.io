		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>Hi, I’m degradka.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I love making PCBs, not just for the sake of it, but because there’s always some idea in my head that I want to bring to life. Right now, that means stuff like working on a rocket computer, designing custom sensor boards, or messing around with random hardware experiments.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I also do programming. I’ve built a few video games in Godot, made some games from scratch in C, and done tons of Arduino projects. Lately, I’ve been deep into reverse engineering two pieces of software from about 20 or 25 years ago, trying to figure out how they work so I can rewrite them and open-source them.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Sometimes I make music too. Jungle, drum and bass, witch house. It’s how I let my emotions out.</p>
		<br>
		<p>I like building things. I like low-level. I like understanding how stuff works and figuring out how to make it do things it’s not supposed to do.</p>
		<br>
		<p>That’s pretty much me.</p>
